(2). How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
Ans.=> To embed audio and video in a webpage, you can use the `<audio>` and `<video>` tags introduced in HTML5. Here's how you can use them:

    =>Embedding Audio:-
          1. Prepare your audio file in a compatible format such as MP3, WAV, or OGG.
          2. Place the audio file in the appropriate location on your web server.
          3. Use the `<audio>` tag to embed the audio in your webpage. 
             -> Here's an example:

          ```html
             <audio controls>
                    <source src="path/to/audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    Your browser does not support the audio element.
             </audio>
          ```
             -In the example above, the `src` attribute specifies the path to your audio file, and the `type` attribute specifies the MIME type of the audio file. 
             -The content within the `<audio>` element serves as fallback content for browsers that do not support the `<audio>` tag.

     =>Embedding Video:
           1. Prepare your video file in a compatible format such as MP4, WebM, or OGG.
           2. Place the video file in the appropriate location on your web server.
           3. Use the `<video>` tag to embed the video in your webpage. 
              -> Here's an example:

           ```html
              <video controls>
                     <source src="path/to/video-file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                     Your browser does not support the video element.
              </video>
           ```
            -Similar to the audio example, the `src` attribute specifies the path to your video file, and the `type` attribute specifies the MIME type of the video file. 
            -The content within the `<video>` element serves as fallback content for browsers that do not support the `<video>` tag.

            -The `controls` attribute in both examples adds playback controls (such as play, pause, and volume) to the audio and video elements. 
            -You can also customize the appearance and behavior of the audio and video elements using CSS and JavaScript if needed.

(3). Semantic element in HTML5? 
Ans.=> A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
      -Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
      -Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
      -Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

      -In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:-  

                <article>
                <aside>
                <details>
                <figcaption>
                <figure>
                <footer>
                <header>
                <main>
                <mark>
                <nav>
                <section>
                <summary>
                <time>

(4).  Canvas and SVG tags ?
Ans.=> Canvas:- The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics. 
               -You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

    => SVG:- The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. 
            -Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.
            -An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. 
            -There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.

           -->Difference between SVG and HTML5 Canvas:-
              
                                     SVG	                                                                                             Canvas
                    -Vector based (composed of shapes)	                                                                          -Raster based (composed of pixel)
                    -SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.	                  -Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.
                    -SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.	                          -Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.
                    -SVG can be modified through script and CSS.	                                                          -Canvas can be modified through script only.
                    -Multiple graphical elements, which become the part of the page’s DOM tree.	                                  -Single element similar to <img> in behavior. Canvas diagram can be saved to PNG or JPG format.
