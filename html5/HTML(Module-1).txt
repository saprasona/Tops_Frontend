1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
Ans.=> HTML tags are builiding blocks of HTML page.
    => HTML elements are components thar are used in HTML page.

2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?
Ans.=> The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
       The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).
    => All HTML elements can have attributes.
       Attributes provide additional information about elements.
       Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
       Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".

3. What are Void Elements in HTML?
Ans.=> A void element is an element whose content model never allows it to have contents under any circumstances. Void elements can have attributes. 
       The following is a complete list of the void elements in HTML :- 
       area , base , br , col , command , embed , hr , img , input , keygen , link , meta , param , source , track , wbr.

4. What are HTML Entities?
Ans.=> An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ). 
       Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).
       
    => Some Useful HTML Character Entities:-

              Result	  Description	         Entity Name
                <	  less than	            &lt;
                >	  greater than	            &gt;
                &	  ampersand	            &amp;
                "	  double quotation mark     &quot;

5. What are different types of lists in HTML?
Ans.=> HTML lists allow the content to follow a proper semantic structure. All the tags in the list require opening and closing tags. 
       
    => There are 3 types of lists in HTML, namely:
              a. Unordered List
              b. Ordered List
              c. Description List
       
       a. Unordered List:- An Unordered list is used to create a list of related items, in bulleted or unordered format. 
                           It starts with the <ul> tag, followed by the <li> tag to show list items inside <ul> tag. 
       b. Ordered List:- The Ordered lists have an order which is either numerical or alphabetical. 
                         The <ol> tag is used to create ordered lists in HTML and just like unordered list, we use <li> tag to define or show lists inside <ol> tag.
       c. Description List:- A description list is a type of list where each item has a description. 
                             It is also known as a definition list. 
                             The <dl> tag is used to create description list, the <dt> tag defines the item, and the <dd> tag describes each item in list.                  
     =>  HTML List Tags:-

                Tag	            Description
               <ul>	        Defines an unordered list
               <ol>	        Defines an ordered list
               <li>	        Defines a list item
               <dl>	        Defines a description list
               <dt>	        Defines a term in a description list
               <dd>	        Describes the term in a description list

6. What is the 'class' attributes in HTML?
Ans.=> The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.
       However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.
       The class attribute is part of the Global Attributes, and can be used on any HTML element.

7. What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML elements?
Ans.=> The difference between Class and ID:-
       -  A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.
       - "class" assigned to an element has its name starts with "." followed by class name, While In HTML, for an element, the ID name starts with the "#" symbol followed 
          by a unique name assigned to it.
       -  Multiple class selectors can be attached to an element, While Only one ID selector can be attached to an element.
       -  ID is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, While ID is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element.

8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?
Ans.=> Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:-

               <b> - Bold text
               <strong> - Important text
               <i> - Italic text
               <em> - Emphasized text
               <mark> - Marked text
               <small> - Smaller text
               <del> - Deleted text
               <ins> - Inserted text
               <sub> - Subscript text
               <sup> - Superscript text

9. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?
Ans.=>  
                                Cellpadding                                                                                            Cellspacing

     - It specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents.	                                  -  It specifies the space between adjacent cells.
     - It is created by using HTML <table> tag but type attribute is set to cellpadding.	                          -  It is also created by using HTML <table> tag but type attribute is set to cellspacing.
     - It is mainly meant for a single cell.	                                                                          -  Cellspacing can get subjected to more than one cell.
     - The default cellpadding value is 1. 	                                                                          -  The default cellspacing value is 2.
     - Cellpadding is widely used and considered to be an effective mean.	                                          -  Cellspacing is less effective than Cellpadding.
     - Cellpadding is an attribute.	                                                                                  -  Cellspacing is also an attribute.

10. How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?
Ans.=> We use the colspan and rowspan attribute, to merge cells in HTML. 
       The rowspan attribute is for the number of rows a cell should merge, whereas the colspan attribute is for the number of columns a cell should merge. 
       The attribute should be placed inside the <td> tag.

11. What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?
Ans.=> A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
      - A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
      - Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
      - The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
      - The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
      -> Here are the block-level elements in HTML:-

      <address>   <article>      <aside>     <blockquote>   <canvas>    <dd>        <div>      <dl>        <dt>        <tfoot>  
      <fieldset>  <figcaption>   <figure>    <ul>           <video>     <footer>    <form>     <h1>-<h6>   <header>    <table>  
      <hr>        <li>           <main>      <nav>          <noscript>  <ol>        <p>        <pre>       <section> 


   => An inline element does not start on a new line.
     - An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
     - This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
     -> Here are the inline elements in HTML:-

      <a>        <abbr>    <acronym>    <b>        <bdo>    <big>      <br>        <button>    <cite>    <code>       <dfn>     
      <img>      <input>   <kbd>        <label>    <map>    <object>   <output>    <q>         <samp>    <script>     <select>
      <small>    <span>    <strong>     <sub>      <sup>    <tt>       <var>       <em>        <i>       <textarea>   <time>
     
    - An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

12. How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?
Ans.=> HTML links are hyperlinks.
      -You can click on a link and jump to another document.
      -When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
      -A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!
      -> create a Hyperlink in HTML:-

                             <html>
                                  <head>
                                       <title> Anchor Tag </title>
                                  </head>
                                  <body>
                                       <!--href=>hyperlink referance-->
                                       <a href="http://github.com/"target="_blank">Go to Github</a>
                                       <a href="02_introduction.txt"target="_blank">Click Here</a>
                                 </body>
                           </html>.

13. What is the use of an iframe tag?
Ans.=> An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. 
      -It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page.
      -They are commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.

14. What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?
Ans.=> The HTML <span> tag is used for grouping and applying styles to inline elements.
      -The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. 
      -The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
      -The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.
      
           ->Example:-                             <!DOCTYPE html>
                                                   <html>
                                                      <head>
                                                            <title>HTML span Tag</title>
                                                      </head>
                                                      <body>
                                                            <p>This is a paragraph <span style = "color:#FF0000;">
                                                               This is a paragraph</span>This is a paragraph</p>
      
                                                            <p><span style = "color:#8866ff;">
                                                                 This is another paragraph</span></p>
                                                       </body>
                                                    </html>


15. How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?
Ans.=> The most common & simple way to add background image is using the background image attribute inside the <body> tag.
      -The background attribute which we specified in the <body> tag is not supported in HTML5.
      -> To insert a picture into a background image of a web page:-
                           
                                 <html>
                                      <head>
                                            <title>My Webpage</title>
                                      </head>

16. How are active links different from normal links?
Ans.=> The default color for normal and active links is blue. 
      -Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed over that link; others recognize active links when the link has the focus. 
      -Those that don’t have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link. 

17. What are the different tags to separate sections of text?
Ans.=> <br> tag –> It is used to separate the line of text. 
       It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.

20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML? 
Ans.=> Logical Tags:-
      -Logical tags refer to the semantic elements in HTML that are used to define the structure and meaning of content. 
      -These elements convey the purpose or role of the content, making it more accessible to both humans and machines. 
      -Logical tags are designed to provide information about the content rather than its appearance.

     -Examples of logical tags in HTML5 include:- <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <h1> to <h6>,
                                                  <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, and many more. 
     -These tags help structure the content and provide semantic information about the sections, headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, and other elements.
     
    => Physical Tags:-
      -The term "physical tags" is less commonly used, but it could refer to the presentational or formatting elements in HTML. 
      -These elements are used to define the appearance or visual presentation of content, rather than its meaning or structure.

      -In earlier versions of HTML, there were various physical tags, such as <b>, <i>, <u>, <font>, <strike>, and <center>, among others. 
      -These tags directly influenced the appearance of the text or elements, indicating bold, italic, underlined text, font properties, strikethrough, or center alignment.
